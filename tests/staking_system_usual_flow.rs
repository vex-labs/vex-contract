// This file contains very basic tests for the staking system's usual flow
// Two user's stake some amount of $VEX, three matches with profit are ended
// Check that treasury balance and other balances are increased
// Someone swaps the profit twice after some time
// We check that the user balances are updated correctly
// One user unstakes and withdraws some amount
// One user unstakes and withdraws all amount

// TODO: Make these tests acutually good and merge with usual flow
// to decrease time to run tests
