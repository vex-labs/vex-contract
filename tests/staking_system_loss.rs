// This file contains very basic tests for the staking system when a loss occurs
// Two user's stake some amount of $VEX, a match with a loss is ended
// Check that the user's lose some amount of staked $VEX
// One user unstakes some amount and withdraws
// One user unstakes all amount and withdraws all

// TODO: Make these tests acutually good
